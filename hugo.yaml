    content: |-
      I am a professional in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, with a focus on artificial intelligence and data science, and currently completing my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. I have worked developing deep learning models for industrial usage, which includes gathering the necessary data, researching the optimal machine learning model for the given problem, and writing the necessary code to train and deploy the final product.

      My main interest is applying artificial intelligence concepts and algorithms into different researching areas, like computer vision, natural language processing, cybersecurity or quantum computation. Implementing efficient computational solutions to real industry problems and challenges is my current professional objective.
